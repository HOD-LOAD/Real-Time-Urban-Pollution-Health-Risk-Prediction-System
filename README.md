# Real-Time Urban Pollution & Health Risk Prediction System

🚀 A data-driven system that predicts **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning, visualizes pollution trends, and assesses **health risks** for citizens.  

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ✅ Machine Learning model for AQI prediction  
- ✅ Interactive **Plotly Dash dashboard** with:
  - Animated **city-wise AQI map**
  - AQI category distribution (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.)
  - Health risk interpretation for citizens
- ✅ Real-time AQI prediction on new data  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebooks/eda_visualization.py` → Exploratory data analysis  
- `src/train_model.py` → Train ML model  
- `src/predict_aqi.py` → Predict AQI for new data  
- `src/aqi_dashboard_map.py` → Interactive AQI dashboard (map + animation)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Dash)  
- Machine Learning for AQI prediction  
- Geospatial visualization
